# python-challenge
Module 3 Challenge
This homework challenge was divided into two parts. In the first part, PyBank, I analyzed the supplied csv file and created a python script. From there, I discerned several different values related to the data set. I then printed out the required results in both the terminal and a text file. The second part, PyPoll, was much the same as the first. This time, the data set was much larger. We were analyzing poll data and printing out who won. During the beginning stages of the first part of this homework, I worked with Maggy Barnes and Shaun Pizzeck. I also utilized the course tutor in order to help me understand the calculation of the total changes in profits/losses. Finally, I had the askBCS learning assistant help me get the date portion printed out in the 'Greatest Increase in Profits'.
